Source code made by Stefan Ruschel and Andrus Giraldo to generate the data and figures for the paper:

	Master stability curves for traveling waves
	by Stefan Ruschel and Andrus Giraldo

The source code is made in Matlab2022, and uses the latest version of the software package "DDE-Biftools" (https://github.com/DDE-BifTool/DDE-Biftool).

The source code is contained in the folder RG_MasterEquation, and the two main scripts to be executed are the following: 
	-	mainGenData.m: this script generates the data for the manuscript. It will generate the necessary ".mat" files to be used for ploting the figures. The ".mat" files will be stored in the Data folder.
	-	mainFigGen.m: this script generates the ".eps" and ".png" figures for the paper using the ".mat" files generated by "mainGenData.m". 

Currently, all the data must be computed once due to the size constraints of GitHub.

Please change the scripts to load the correct address where your installation of DDE-Biftool is saved.

Please cite our manuscript if you plan to use part of our code in your research.

Under Construction: Currently, the scripts that generate the data for the two-bound solution have not been uploaded since we are cleaning and documenting the corresponding code. We will upload the corresponding scripts on September 30th at the latest.
